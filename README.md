# Animated Loader Web Page

!(https://i.imghippo.com/files/AXMrS1728794565.jpg)

This project is a simple animated loader with a "Loading..." text and a link to a YouTube channel, styled with CSS and HTML.

## Features

- **CSS Animation**: The page features an animated loading bar created using multiple `<span>` elements styled with CSS. Each bar fades in and out in a sequential pattern.
- **Dark Theme**: The background color of the page is set to a dark shade (`#1E212D`), giving it a modern, sleek appearance.
- **Call to Action**: There is a link that encourages users to subscribe to a YouTube channel, designed with a custom style.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used for the structure of the page.
- **CSS3**: Used for styling the page and creating the loading animation with keyframes.

## How It Works

- The page consists of a `.loader` div which contains 18 `<span>` elements. Each span is animated using the `@keyframes opacity` rule, making them fade in and out one after the other in a smooth sequence.
- Below the loader, a "Loading..." text is displayed in the center.
- There's also a call-to-action button that links to a YouTube channel, styled with CSS to fit the overall theme of the page.
